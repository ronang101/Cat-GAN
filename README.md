# Cat Image Generation with GANs

This repository contains the TensorFlow implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) trained to generate realistic cat images. The project demonstrates the power of GANs in generating lifelike images that can sometimes be indistinguishable from real photos.

## Project Structure

- **cats_training.py**: The main training script for the GAN model. Detailed comments within the script explain the training process, architecture choices, and TensorFlow operations.
- **human_model_tester_game.py**: An interactive game built with Tkinter that allows users to guess whether displayed cat images are real or generated by the GAN model. On average, the model can trick users 1 out of every 10 times, showcasing its effectiveness.
- **flip_images.py**: A utility script used for data augmentation by flipping images horizontally. This helps in training the GAN more effectively by increasing the variability in the training data.
- **understanding_conv_layers.py**: This script provides insights into the workings of Conv2DTranspose layers used in the GAN's generator, helping to explain how the model constructs images from learned patterns.

## Requirements

The project is developed using TensorFlow and relies on specific versions of CUDA and cuDNN for GPU acceleration:

- cudnn=8.1.0.77-h3e0f4f4_0
- cudatoolkit=11.2.2-h933977f_10

A requirements.txt file is included in the repository, detailing all necessary Python packages. Install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


**Note:** Ensure that your environment meets the CUDA and cuDNN version requirements for optimal performance.

## GPU Specifications

The model was trained and tested on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti with the following specifications:

- CUDA Cores: 1024
- Graphics Boost Clock: 1485 MHz
- Memory Data Rate: 12.00 Gbps
- Memory Interface: 128-bit
- Memory Bandwidth: 192.03 GB/s
- Total Available Graphics Memory: 12160 MB
- Dedicated Video Memory: 4096 MB GDDR6

These specifications highlight the GPU's capability to handle deep learning tasks and specifically the training of GAN models for image generation.

## Getting Started

To test your ability to distinguish between real and generated images, play the interactive game:


## Understanding GANs

The project also aims to provide educational insights into the mechanics of GANs, especially focusing on convolutional operations. The understanding_conv_layers.py script and accompanying diagrams offer a visual and theoretical explanation of how GANs learn to generate images.
